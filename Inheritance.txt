Inheritance

TYPES OF INHERITANCE:

Single Inheritance:
    - Class inherits from one base class
    class DerivedClass : BaseClass{}
Multilevel Inheritance:
    - Class derived from another derived class
    class FurtherDerivedClass : Derived Class{}
Hierarchical Inheritance:
    - Multiple classes derive from one base class
    class DerivedClass2 :  BaseClass{}
Multiple Inheritance:
    - Derived class inherits from multiple base classes
    class DerivedClass : BaseClass1, BaseClass2{}
 
ACCESS MODIFIERS:

Public:
    - Means that the member is accessible from any other code
Protected:
    - Means that the member is accessible within its class and by derived class instances
Private:
    - Means that the member is accessible only within its class
Internal:
    - Means that the member is accessible only within files in the same assembly

METHOD OVERRIDING:

Override:
    - This method is used to provide a new implementation of a method that is inherited from a base class. 
    - The method in the base class must be marked as virtual, abstract, or override for it to be overridden in the derived class.

Virtual:
    - This method allows derived classes to override it with their own implementation
